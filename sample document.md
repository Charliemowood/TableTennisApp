#### Hello there!

This is version 3 of a sample document, now with slightly more text!!!

To add to the project:
Go to the directory that you want the project to be in.
In terminal use 'git clone CLONE_LINK'.
Switch to required branch, or make a new one.  DONT MERGE TO MASTER, merge to development, when a feature is working.

meaningful commits are welcome.
